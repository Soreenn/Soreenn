# :star: Welcome to you ! :)

Hi, I am a seventeen year old student studying at the CPNV. For now, I don’t have any projects yet. Mainly because I need to learn the basics first.

But I'm trying to get better everyday and hopefully one day I will create my own blogs. I think blogs are a good start. 

I will put some news about my projects here. Don’t hesitate to take a look at them! 

Thank you for your attention!
